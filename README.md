# Assignment_2

OOP Assignment 2, android game called Ninja Cat. The goal in the game is to kill as many opponents and  collects as much coins as possible.

Game should run on any device with Android version 5.1.1 or higher, yet the game was tested using Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and this is the device I would recommend to use because of it's big screen size.

In order to run the game on android device using processing follow the steps:

<b>1. Download and select android module in processing.</b>

<b>2. Connect your device (smartphone) to the computer.</b>

<b>3. Run the program.</b>
